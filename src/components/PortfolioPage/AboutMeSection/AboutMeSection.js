			<p>From the first moment I realized I could literally spin keystrokes into real things I was hooked.</p>
			<p>Currently I work designing, crafting, testing, and deploying many different types of eCommerce products in many different languages.</p>
			<p>I am a consistently evolving and learning to be a better person. Meditation and mindfulness is an important part of life. Meditating shorty at Piazzale Michelangelo in Florence was a life altering moment in a very positive way.</p>
